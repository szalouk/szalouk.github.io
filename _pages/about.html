<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I’m an master’s student in Computer Science at Stanford University, with a concentration on artifical intelligence. I am advised by Prof. [Stefano Ermon][https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/], and have worked closely with Prof. [Andrew Ng][https://www.andrewng.org/]. I completed my B.A.Sc. in Elecrical Engineering with highest distinction at the University of Toronto, where I worked with Prof. [Andreas Moshovos][https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~moshovos/000/doku.php].</p> <p>I am interested in working on topics such as uncertainty quantification, generative modeling, and computational fairness. These areas, I believe, are key to ensuring that machine learning technologies are employed responsibly, particularly in sectors where they may have a profound impact on human life and wellbeing. Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collobrating in any of these areas!</p> </body></html>
