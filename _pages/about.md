I'm an master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University, with a concentration on artifical intelligence. I am advised by Prof. [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/), and have worked closely with Prof. [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/). I completed my B.A.Sc. in Elecrical Engineering with highest distinction at the University of Toronto, where I worked with Prof. [Andreas Moshovos](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~moshovos/000/doku.php).

I am interested in working on topics such as uncertainty quantification, generative modeling, and computational fairness. These areas, I believe, are key to ensuring that machine learning technologies are employed responsibly, particularly in sectors where they may have a profound impact on human life and wellbeing. Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collobrating in any of these areas!
