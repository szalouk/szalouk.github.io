I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University, working with Prof. [Kilian Q. Weinberger](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/) and Prof. [Chris De Sa](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cdesa/). Previously, I was an MS student in Computer Science at Stanford University, with a concentration on artifical intelligence. I was advised by Prof. [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/), and have worked closely with Prof. [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/). I completed my B.A.Sc. in Elecrical Engineering with highest distinction at the University of Toronto, where I worked with Prof. [Andreas Moshovos](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~moshovos/000/doku.php).

I am interested in working on topics such as uncertainty quantification, generative modeling, and computational fairness. These areas, I believe, are key to ensuring that machine learning technologies are employed responsibly, particularly in sectors where they may have a profound impact on human life and wellbeing. Please feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in collobrating in any of these areas!
